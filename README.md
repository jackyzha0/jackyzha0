### what I'm working on
Currently doing an internship [@hootsuite](http://hootsuite.com/), working on a mix of frontend and infrastructure! On the side, I'm contributing to [@bentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) as part of the [@MLH-Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/) and working on internal tooling/event logistics at [@nwPlus](https://github.com/nwplus). In my spare time, I'm polishing up [reflect](https://github.com/getreflect) and [ctrl-v](https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v) and a host of other side-projects that may or may not see the light of day :)
