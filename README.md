### :wave: hey there! i'm Jacky.
(he/him)

I am a passionate software developer from :pushpin: Vancouver, Canada trying to build solutions to the worldâ€™s problems. On the side, I love to help run hackathons, make side projects, and rock climb!

### what I'm working on
Currently doing an internship [@hootsuite](http://hootsuite.com/), working on a mix of frontend and infrastructure! On the side, I'm contributing to [@bentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) as part of the [@MLH-Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/). In my spare time, I'm polishing up [reflect](https://github.com/getreflect) and [ctrl-v](https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v) and a host of other side-projects that may or may not see the light of day :)
