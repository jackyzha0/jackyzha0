### what I'm working on
Currently doing an internship @hootsuite, working on a mix of frontend and infrastructure! On the side, I'm contributing to @bentoML as part of the @MLH-Fellowship. In my spare time, I'm polishing up [reflect](https://github.com/jackyzha0/reflect-chrome) and [ctrl-v](https://github.com/jackyzha0/ctrl-v) and a host of other side-projects that may or may not see the light of day :)
